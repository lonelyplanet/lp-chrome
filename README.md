# Lonely Planet's Chrome Extension
This chrome extension adds a new tab widget as well as a search widget to chrome.

Every time you open a new tab, you'll get a beautifully curated image from one of our covered places.

You can also type "lp" and hit tab in the Chrome omnibox, and you'll be able to search our places.

### Packaging
Run `gulp build`, and `gulp package` to generate the zip file.

Then log in to the Chrome Web store with the `lplabs@lonelyplanet.com` credentials from Last Pass and upload the zip file.
